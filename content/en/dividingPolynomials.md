## Dividing Polynomials - Algebraic Fractions

#### Method for Long division 
- Arrange the divisor and the dividend in descending powers of x.
- Each term of the quotient is obtained by dividing the first term of the divisor into the first term of the new dividend.
- After each division, the next step is to subtract and bring down the next term.
- The process is repeated until the remainder is of a lower power than the divisor.

##### Note:
- If there are any consecutive powers of x missing, these should be included by using 0 as their coefficient.
- All terms of the same power are kept in the same vertical column.

#### For example
<div markdown="1">
    <p style="display:inline"> Divide: \( x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x + 8 by x + 1 \) </p><br>
    <p style="display:inline"> Divident: \( x^3 - 5x^2 + 2x + 8 \) </p><br>
    <p style="display:inline"> Divisor: \( x + 1 \) </p><br>
    Write 
    <p style="display:inline"> 
    \polylongdiv{X^3+X^2-1}{X-1}
    </p><br>
</div>
