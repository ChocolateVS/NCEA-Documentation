## Complex numbers
Under real number system square roots of negative numbers does not exist. But in complex number system it is possible to find square roots of negative numbers by doing the following substitution.

<div markdown="1">
<p style="display:inline-block"> \( i = \sqrt{-1}\) or \( i^2 = -1 \)</p>
</div>

A complex number is made of real and imaginary numbers. We represent the set of complex numbers by letter C. The letter z represent arbitrary complex number. <br>
<div markdown="1">
<p style="display:inline-block"> Any complex number z is written as \( z = x + yi\) or \( z = a + bi \).</p>
We call x, the real part of z written as <p style="display:inline-block">\( x = Re(z) \).</p> <br>
We call y, the imaginary part of z written as <p style="display:inline-block">\( y = Im(z) \).</p> <br>
Note: That Im(z) does not include i, it is just the coefficient of i.
<br>
For Example, find the Real, Re(z) and Imaginary Im(z) parts given complex numbers <br>
<p style="display:inline-block">\( z = 2 - 6i \), \(Re(z) = 2, Im(z) = 6 \).</p> <br>
<p style="display:inline-block">\( z = {3 + 5i \over 6}\), \(Re(z) = {3 \over 6}, Im(z) = {5 \over 6}\).</p> <br>
<p style="display:inline-block">\( z = (2 - i)(3 + 4i) = 6 - 3i + 8i - 4i^2 = 6 + 5i + 4 = 10 + 5i \), Re(z) = 10, Im(z) = 5 \).</p> 
</div>

### Adding and Subtracting Complex Numbers
In adding or subtracting two or more complex numbers, ADD the real parts and ADD the imaginary parts of the complex numbers.
<div markdown="1">
Example: If <p style="display:inline-block"> \(z=2-5i\) and \(w=-3+7i\).</p>
Find:
	<p style="display:inline-block"> \(z=2-5i + -3+7i\).</p>
	z - w
	3w - 2z
</div>
