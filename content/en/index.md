# Welcome

Hi there, Welcome to my documentation for NCEA Level 3 - Math, Physics, and Chemistry!

This site is currently being developed and tonnes of new information is being added. Hopefully the majority of notes and information for the main topics, will be complete within the next few months,

I will eventually add some of the nzqa past papers with the answers and explantion, 
so that this can be used as a good study resource for the externals.

I will also add content for the scholarship courses in Math, Physics and Chem

Have fun studying :)
